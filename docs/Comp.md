# Predicting Road Accident Risk
Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 10

*KAGGLE* $\cdot$ *PLAYGROUND PREDICTION COMPETITION* $\cdot$ *18 DAYS TO GO*

## Overview
Welcome to the **2025 Kaggle Playground Series**! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

* **Your Goal:** Predict the likelihood of accidents on different types of roads.
* **Two-part Challenge:** This is teamed up with [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for a two-part challenge. The Stack Overflow Challenge is the second part and involves developing a web application. We encourage you to check out the [Stack Overflow Challenge](https://stackoverflow.com/beta/challenges/79780240/kaggle-stack-overflow-two-part-challenge?source=kaggle)!
* **Special Badge:** If you complete both challenges, you'll receive a special **"Code Scientist" badge** on both Kaggle and Stack Overflow.
* **Start:** 13 days ago
* **Close:** 18 days to go

## Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using the **[Root Mean Squared Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square_deviation)** between the predicted and the observed target.

### Submission File
For each `id` in the test set, you must predict an `accident_risk` of between 0 and 1. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

| id | accident\_risk |
| :--- | :--- |
| 517754 | 0.352 |
| 517755 | 0.992 |
| 517756 | 0.021 |
| etc. | |

## Timeline
* **Start Date:** October 1, 2025
* **Entry Deadline:** Same as the Final Submission Deadline
* **Team Merger Deadline:** Same as the Final Submission Deadline
* **Final Submission Deadline:** October 31, 2025

*All deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted.*

## About the Tabular Playground Series
The goal is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science.

### Synthetically-Generated Datasets
These challenges generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are **synthetically generated from real-world data** to provide interesting data while ensuring test labels are not publicly available.

## Prizes
* **1st Place:** Choice of Kaggle merchandise
* **2nd Place:** Choice of Kaggle merchandise
* **3rd Place:** Choice of Kaggle merchandise

*Note: Kaggle merchandise will only be awarded once per person in this series to encourage participation from beginners.*
